# Tour e-commerce. Server & Site.

Lovely project to implement every Node js feature i've learned. App running locally. 

Clone the main branch repo and run:

  - `npm install` to download all dependencies.
  - `npm start` to run server with nodemon.
  - `npm run watch:js` to run parcel bundler for a dev bundle or `npm run build:js` for a production compressed bundle.

localhost is going  to be at: [Local-Host:](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/'
